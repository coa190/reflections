When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I work on my project on more than
    one computer or when I collaborate on 
    the project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might want to ignore the commits from
    other colaborators.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone is the copy of the repository from 
    GitHub to local computer or copy inside 
    local computer. Fork is essentially a clone
    inside the GitHub. Branch is a parallel
    array of commits inside one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    In such way git can track if update of the
    remote repository diverges from updates of
    the local repository thus creating the conflict.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would send last version of the file to my
    colaborators by email and marked them the
    changes I proposed. Sometimes it can be easier,
    depending of complexity of the project.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Creating separate branch is safer because it 
    avoids conflicts and lets collaborators to
    evaluate my suggestion. Commiting to the master
    would be just more simple procedure.
